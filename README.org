* Docker-scripts
Build, run, remove images, start, stop and remove containers.
Tired of the dockerCLI syntax, I decided to make some bash scripts to handle
most of the common use cases I encounter.

** Docker-run

/dockerrun.sh/ gives you a list of the current available images on your local machine,
upon selection the image is run into a container.
You can pass any argument that is compatible with =docker run=.

** Docker-remove-container, docker-kill, docker-remove-image, docker-start

Same as above, the prompts you with a list of available images/containers
that you want to remove/kill/start.

** Docker-build

It should be run from inside a folder with a Dockerfile, the script simply calls:
: $ docker build -t <name> . && docker run -p <port> <name>

You have two flags to set: =-n <name>= and the occasionnal =-p <port>= which is defaulted to 3000:3000.
I usually alias it to =dcb=, usage is then:
: $ dcb -n <name> -p 3123:3000
